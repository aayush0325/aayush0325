Hey! I'm Aayush Khanna, currently pursuing my undergrad in Civil Engineering at IIT (BHU) Varanasi. But my real interest lies in computer science, I'm proficient at full stack development using Node.js/TypeScript and I have a keen interest in systems programming. Here are some cool things about me :)

- I was selected for Google Summer of Code 2025 with [Stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib).
- I've been recognised as one of the core contributors to [Stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib)!
- I've interned at a startup as a full stack dev at Numberlabs.
- I'm really into low level programming!
